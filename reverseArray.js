//Given a numerical array, reverse the order of values, in-place. The reversed array should have the same length, with existing elements moved to other indices so that order of elements is reversed. Working ‘in-place’ means that you cannot use a second array – move values within the array that you are given. Do not use built-in functions.

function reverse(arr){
    
}

//TEST CASES
console.log(reverse([1,3,5])) //[5,3,1]
console.log(reverse([-1,3,-5])) //[-5,3,-1]
console.log(reverse([1,2,3,4,5])) //[5,4,3,2,1]
console.log(reverse([2,10,13,15])) //[15,13,10,2]
